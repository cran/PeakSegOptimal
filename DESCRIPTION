Title: Optimal Segmentation Subject to Up-Down Constraints
Description: Computes optimal changepoint models using the
 Poisson likelihood for non-negative count data,
 subject to the PeakSeg constraint:
 the first change must be up, second change down, third change up, etc.
 For more info about the models and algorithms,

 Algorithms for Peak Detection"
